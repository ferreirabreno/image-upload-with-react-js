# What is React.js?

React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to build reusable UI components, manage the state of their application, and render updates efficiently. It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve performance by minimizing the number of DOM updates required to reflect changes in the state of the application. React is widely used for building complex, dynamic web applications and is considered to be one of the most popular front-end development tools in use today.

# Configuring React project step-by-step
1. Install Node.js: React is built with JavaScript, so you will need Node.js installed on your development machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website.

2. Install the Create React App tool by running:
```sh
npm install -g create-react-app.
```

2. Run the following command to create a new project: 
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript.
```

5. Configure the `tsconfig.json` file: This file is used to configure TypeScript for your project.
```json
```
